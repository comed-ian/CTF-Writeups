## Toddler's Bottle Challenges

### [fd]

After ssh-ing into the box, we can run `ls` to see that there are three files present, a 32-bit Linux ELF executable, the source code for the executable, and a flag file.  Attempting to `cat` the flag yields a privilege error because we are a guest user.  Consequently, we need to use the executable to read the flag.  Examining the source code shows a call to `system("/bin/cat flag");` if the input buffer, read from a calculated file descriptor, is equivalent to `"LETMEWIN\n"`.  

~~~c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
char buf[32];
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
        if(argc<2){
                printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");
                return 0;
        }
        int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
        int len = 0;
        len = read(fd, buf, 32);
        if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
                printf("good job :)\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                exit(0);
        }
        printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
        return 0;

}
~~~

The trick for this is to understand that the Linux file descriptor for standard input is 0.  Since `fd` is calculated by taking the input argument minus `0x1234`, we need to use an input argument of 4660 (the equivalent value in decimal).  This allows us to pass standard input into the binary to be processed.  We can create a file with the required text, or use `echo` (which will automatically append a new line `\n` character to the end of the text).  Using `echo "LETMEWIN" | ./fd 4660` yields the flag.


### collision

We are presented with a similar situation to the previous challenge, and need to use the `col` binary to read the flag.  In this case, we need to present an input of 20 bytes which will be processed and compared to `0x21DD09EC`.  The "processing" includes casting the input from a character string to an integer array.  Since an integer is four bytes, the input will parsed into five groups.  It is important to run `file` on the binary to determine endianess - in this case, the result is `ELF 32-bit LSB executable`, indicating little-endian (Least Signficant Byte).  This means that the bytes in each group will be reversed when processed as integers.  The integers are then summed into a `res` variable which is returned and compared to `0x21DD09EC`.  

~~~c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
unsigned long hashcode = 0x21DD09EC;
unsigned long check_password(const char* p){
        int* ip = (int*)p;
        int i;
        int res=0;
        for(i=0; i<5; i++){
                res += ip[i];
        }
        return res;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
        if(argc<2){
                printf("usage : %s [passcode]\n", argv[0]);
                return 0;
        }
        if(strlen(argv[1]) != 20){
                printf("passcode length should be 20 bytes\n");
                return 0;
        }

        if(hashcode == check_password( argv[1] )){
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                return 0;
        }
        else
                printf("wrong passcode.\n");
        return 0;
}
~~~

We can calculate `0x21DD09EC/5` to determine which integers to send.  The result is `113626824.8`, which means we can send `113626825` four times and `113626824` once to return `0x21DD09EC`.  Converting these values to hex yields `0x6C5CEC9` and `0x6C5CEC8`, respectively.  Again, we need to arrange in little endian format to correctly process the integers.  It is easiest to use `echo -e -n` and pipe the result to the executable given the bytes are not ASCII characters (here the `-n` flag suppresses a new line character, which is necessary otherwise we would input 21 bytes, not 20).  Running `./col $(echo -n -e "\xc8\xce\xc5\x6\xc9\xce\xc5\x6\xc9\xce\xc5\x6\xc9\xce\xc5\x6\xc9\xce\xc5\x6")` yields the flag.

### bof
For this challenge we are provided links to download a bof executable and the corresponding C source code.  Doing a quick check with `file`, `bof` is again a 32-bit little-endian ELF executable.  A quick scan of the source code shows a `gets` vulnerability in the `puts()` function. Opening the binary in gdb and diassembling `func()` provides disassembled instructions: 

~~~gdb

~~~

This again shows there is no bounds checking on the input; the binary will store the input buffer at `esp` which is equal to `ebp - 0x48`.
