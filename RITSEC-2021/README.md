# RITSEC 2021 Reversing / Binary Exploitation Challenge Write-ups
The following write-up includes three challenges from RIT's RITSEC CTF 2021 competition.  All three challenges were in the `REV/BIN` category and featured some clever reverse engineering or binary exploitation.  I completed the challenges with OffSec classmate Evan, and certainly could not have progressed through some mental blocks without his ingenuity.

## Snek - 100 pts
#### Framing the Challenge
Kicking off the `REV/BIN` category is a challenge called "snek".  All we are given is a `snek` file and the hint `no step on snek` from the author, `~knif3`.  For those unfamiliar, the hint refers to a popular meme with a play on the [Gadsden Flag](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gadsden-flag-dont-tread-on-me). 

![no-step-on-snek](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/116/586/96f.jpg).  

This might not be much of a hint for some players, so the logical next step is to try and identify the file.  Running `file` simply returns `data` which proves that this is not a standard ELF or PE executable.  `strings` reveals some useful information, including `__init__` and `__name__`, which are indicative of a Python file.  Suddenly the hint makes sense!  However this is not a Python `.py` source code file, but rather compiled Python bytecode.  


The next hurdle comes when trying to execute the program.  Depending on the version of Python a contestant has installed, the bytecode may or may not execute.  By luck, my attempt at running with Python3 version 3.9+ failed, but Evan's v3.7 executed it without an error.  This led us to create a Docker container running Python 3.7 instead of trying to revert my Python version.  We set about determining an appropriate disassembler to add to the Dockerfile's installation dependencies and found a suitable candidate, [xdis](https://pypi.org/project/xdis/).  This utility also requires Python's `click`.  These dependencies are installed in the Python 3.7 Docker container using the Dockerfile shown below: 

~~~Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7

run pip install xdis	
run pip install click 
 
user 1000:1000
~~~

The bytecode can now be executed within the container, revealing the prompt `Enter my name: `. Entering a random guess indicates an unsuccessful answer and terminates execution.  

~~~shell
‚ùØ python3 snek
Enter my name: comed-ian
WRONG
~~~

Clearly some reverse engineering is required to identify the correct input and retrieve the flag.

#### Reverse Engineering the Bytecode
As mentioned previously, the `xdis` utility can assist by disassembling the compiled Python bytecode.  `xdis` can be run using a Python script, but also has a convenient CLI extension: `pydisasm`.  Beforehand, the file must be changed to use a `.pyc` extension so the disassembler can process it.  Using `pydisasm snek.pyc` yields a significant amount of metadata which indicates the source is Python 3.7 bytecode, as we established earlier.  Furthermore, the utility disassembles each method.  There are multiple methods recognized, however the key to this challenge exists in the `<module>` and `__init__` methods, which are described below 

##### <module>
The `<module>` method takes care of user interaction and initializing the environment.  It first creates a `d` object of type `'d'`, which is an object with two methods: `__init__` and `__eq__`.  For the sake of brevity, `__eq__` overloads the `==` operator and checks the equivalence of two parameters. The `__init__` method will be discussed in the next section.  `<module>` proceeds to print the problem prompt and accept user input, storing it in `x`.  Lines 28-34 define an object `a` of type `d`, instantiated with `x` as its input (e.g. `a = d(x)`).  Without any further reverse engineering, it is logical to assume that the `d` object performs an encryption / decryption algorithm, as the following command compares equivalence between `a` and `x`.  This is odd, however, as the resulting control flow either prints out `IS_THIS_THE_FLAG??` followed by `NOPE`, or `WRONG`.  It would therefore seem as if feeding the decrypted key into the program does not, in fact, yield the flag.  We next took a look into the `'d'` method, leading to an investigation of the `__init__` method.

##### __init__
As mentioned above, an object created of type `'d'` is instantiated using the `__init__` method.  This method is relatively simple, and contains the info necessary for solving the challenge.  The method only takes two parameters, `self` and `password`, and the `password` input is first encoded into bytes, assuming a string input.  Next, a 77 byte list is created using a number of defined constants and stored in the member variable `self.decrypt`.  It is also noted that the `__eq__` method uses this `self.decrypt` variable for equivalence checking against an input string.  Furthermore, the loaded bytes appear to be ASCII letter values.  Therefore it is logical to assume that this string either is our key or contains our key.

#### Printing the Key
A simple Python file was created to output the presumed ASCII values as characters.  

~~~python
#!/usr/bin/python3
key = [97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 82, 83, 123, 97, 108, 108, 95, 104, 105, 36, 36, 95, 97, 110, 100, 95, 110, 48, 95, 98, 105, 116, 51, 125]


for k in key: 
    print(chr(k), end="")
~~~

The result was the string: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_RS{all_hi$$_and_n0_bit3}`, which clearly contains the RITSEC flag prefix at the end!  Now it makes sense why the program only printed out negative feedback, because the flag was present in ASCII form the entire time. 

## Fleshwound
#### Framing the Challenge
The next challenge in the `REV/BIN` category, Fleshwound, provided a single file `fleshwound.json` and the hint `Tis but a....`.  Monty Python fans will immediately recognize the truncated quote, though again the hint is not immediately apparent.  Investigation of the `fleshwound.json` file shows a lot of...garbage?  It is not clear how the JSON file should be interpreted.  A number of the fields are either obfuscated or otherwise poorly named and the plain text does not clearly indicate a path forward.  One interesting observation is that the file defines a number of "opcodes", with commands like `event_whenflagclicked`, `sensing_askandwait`, and `operator_equals`.  A quick search for these method names leads to [MIT's Scratch platform](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - an online application meant to introduce children to fundamental programming cconcepts.  This makes logical sense when considered in context with the challenge hint:

![tis_but_a_scratch](https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwrv52wVCC1qmfycwo1_500.png)

The online platform accepts upload files, so long as they have a `.sb3` file extension, and modifying the file to `fleshwound.json.sb3` allows for successful import.

#### Reverse Engineering(?)

![scratch_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comed-ian/CTF-Writeups/main/RITSEC-2021/_images/scratch_1.png)

The next step, now that the Scratch file is uploaded, is half reverse engineering and half understanding how Scratch works. Simple testing showed that the green flag icon runs a prompt asking `What do you seek?`.  This seems to be on the right path, but a seemingly incorrect input does not yield positive or negative feedback.  Searching the JSON file for this string shows that it resides within a `sensing_askandwait` opcode.  It also shows that this "method" calls method `iybEVB.t5+ShRV.(sy,r` as the next "block" which is a `control_if` opcode.  This makes logical sense, as the program should compare the user input with some key.  The operation uses condition `ds7|:EA%,[mCT/qcZQGw` in its comparison, which happens to be the next field.  This `operator_equals` opcode uses defined operands, one of which is `gib flag`!

~~~

The program was re-run using `gib flag` as the input, and the drum icon in the upper right (which is a "Sprite", one of Scratch's animated characters / objects" prints out `RS...{...Hmm is this is a distraction?!...Dancing...`.  Clearly this is on the right path, however some additional investigation must be performed.  Doing some brief recon, the Scratch platform appears to generate code using color-coded blocks and internal variables.  For example, it appears that an `__init__` function is declared which runs `fleshwound.json.py` from the uploaded JSON, which presumably runs the command prompt, but there is no instance where `__init__` is called.  After much poking around, a different Backdrop 1 "Stage" was discovered.  This is essentially another workspace for organizing the Scratch program and defines the behavior for when the green flag is clicked!

![backdrop_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comed-ian/CTF-Writeups/main/RITSEC-2021/_images/backdrop_1.png)

Here it shows that the initial `RS{` are output using the Sprite's `think` command, however the `distract_me` function is called which prints the remaining text.  Clearly this call should be modified to something that prints out the remainder of the flag.  Again, much poking around ensued, until discovery of yet another Backdrop represented by the drum Sprite.  This backdrop contains commands a `finish` function which end with a `}`, which logically represents the rest of the flag.  Navigating back to Backdrop 1 and changing the `broadcast` block from `distract_me and wait` to `finish and wait`, the flag `RS{eeee_whats_th@t_scratch?}` is printed out sequentially!
